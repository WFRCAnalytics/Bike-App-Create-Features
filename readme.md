## Bike-App-Create-Features

This script pulls down the most recent copies of the utah roads and 
trails & pathways datasets (hosted by UGRC), merges and formats them, 
and determines its best bike feature as well as which side of the 
road the feature is on. The final products are 1) existing and 
2) planned line layers for the wfrc-bike-app.

Requires Arcpy, ArcGIS Python API
